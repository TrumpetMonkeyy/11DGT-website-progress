            Over the years the have been thousands of different prototypes, trying out all sorts of new things you can type with. The one you're probably most familiar with, and the most modern one would be the keyboard. However, back in 1874, typewriters were introduced. Before that, writing was a long and often tiring task, done entirely by hand with quills, pens, or pencils.
