                Many people are lead to believe typewriters were the first form of todays keyboard. This actually isn't true, before the typewriter, people had the Hansen Writing Ball. First invented in 1870 by, you guessed it, Malling Hansen. Malling Hansen's goal with the Writing ball was to "improve effeciency and speed of written communication specifically targeted at those with disabilites"

            In 1874, typewriters were introduced, being popularized in the early 1880's becoming extremely common in offices for their potential. With a typewriter, you could write much longer messages, much faster, this increased work space effeciency substantially and by were deemed a necessity for nearly all businesses by mid 1880's. Below you can see the first ever commercially available typewriter, pioneered by a group of four: Christopher Latham Sholes, Frank Haven Hall, Carlos Glidden, and Samuel W. Soule.
