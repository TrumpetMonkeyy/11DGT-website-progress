            Modern keyboards have evolved far beyond their mechanical and membrane-based ancestors, offering a blend of enhanced hardware and powerful software customization. While older keyboards were primarily functional tools with fixed layouts and limited features, today's models integrate programmable keys, RGB lighting, and advanced key switch technology to suit a variety of users, from gamers to professionals. Wireless connectivity, ergonomic designs, and haptic feedback further distinguish modern keyboards, making them more adaptable and comfortable than ever before.

            One of the biggest advancements in modern keyboards is the integration of software-driven customization. Unlike older keyboards, which had no programmability, today's models allow users to remap keys, create macros, and even sync lighting effects with other devices through dedicated software. This fusion of hardware and software enables unparalleled flexibility, catering to both productivity and gaming needs. As artificial intelligence and machine learning continue to advance, the future of keyboards may include predictive typing, adaptive key functions, and even deeper personalization, pushing the boundaries of what a keyboard can do.
