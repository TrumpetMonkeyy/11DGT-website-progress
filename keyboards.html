            In the 1980s, personal computers began to gain popularity, and with them, the need for an efficient input device. The first keyboards, initially developed for early computers, were far simpler than what we use today. These early keyboards were used to interact with computers, allowing users to input commands and text in a way that was much faster than manual methods. By the 1990s, the popularity of computers surged, and with it, the demand for more ergonomic, reliable, and comfortable keyboards grew.

            The first keyboards were relatively rudimentary compared to modern standards, often featuring a limited number of keys and basic functionality. Over time, however, engineers and designers refined the layout and mechanics of keyboards, making them more user-friendly and adaptable to a wide range of computing needs. One of the most significant early keyboard designs was the QWERTY layout, which was initially used for typewriters in the late 19th century but was soon adapted to early computer keyboards. By the 1980s and 1990s, mechanical keyboards and membrane keyboards started to dominate, with companies like IBM, Apple, and Microsoft leading the way. These keyboards were critical in transforming the computer from a specialized tool to something widely used in homes, schools, and offices.
